Ye'll not get me treasure, ye feculent, yellow-bellied sea dog! ... Scupper that!

I'll hang ye by yer ears 'til ye rot, ye cheatin', scurvy-ridden swindler! ... Blow me down!

Ye smell worse than the breath of a kraken, ye black-spotted, barnacle-covered swindler! ... Shiver me timbers!

Ye couldn't hit water if ye fell out of a boat, ye pitiful, flea-bitten halfwit! ... Splice the mainbrace!

I'll strap a cannon to yer bootstraps an' send ye to Davy Jones, ye useless, bilge-drinkin' swine! ... Yarr!

I'll cut out yer tongue an' feed it t' the sharks, ye ghastly, barnacle-covered sea bass! ... Swab the poop deck!

Be that a galleon! No. It be yer mother, ye useless, spineless maggot! ... Scupper that!

I'm more scared of the parrot on me shoulder than ye, ye nattering, wretched monkey! ... Strike yer colors!

I'm more scared of the parrot on me shoulder than ye, ye feeble, fish-kissin' parrot! ... Gangway!

Dead men tell no tales, ye plagued, lice-infested monkey! ... Strike yer colors!
